# Powersleuth

* PowerSleuth is a quick and simple parser for common Windows event logs you might look for in an investigation. It attempts to cut out the noise, while providing easy to digest explanations for what activity occured during each event parsed. It displays findings in timeline format, with a quick review of activity printed to the terminal or more verbose findings exported to a csv.
